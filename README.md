# Snake Program created using Java & FXML
This is a version of the popular arcade game "Snake" created by myself using what I learned in CS3330 Object-Oriented Programming in the fall of 2020. I added a lot of extra functionality to the basic game such as being able to alter the snake speed, grid size, block size, and whether walls exist, & the color scheme and music for the game are selected on random when play is pressed. MVC architecture is also utilized so that the model (data) communicates with the view (stage) through the controller. Please note that I did not use any online resources or code related to an already made version of the game; any sources I did utilize are cited in the code. Made by Noah Free.
